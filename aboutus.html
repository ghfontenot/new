					<h2>Short Biographies of the Guys!</h2>
					<p>Mark Fowler loves games of all types. He loves video games, board games, card games, tabletop rpgs... you name it, and he's played it. But most importantly, Mark loves Magic the Gathering. It's his favorite game. Mark loves to play Magic, think about Magic, brew Magic decks, watch pro Magic events, and most importantly, talk about Magic! You can hear Mark talk about all kinds of Magic the Gathering and Magic related ideas on our podcast.</p>
					<p>Anthony Fontenot loves Magic the Gathering and the thrill of competition. You can usually find him in Louisville's very own card shop Bluegrass Magic every friday night playing FNM. Anthony has been playing Magic since before high school, but has recently been playing in local high level competitions and is always ready to discuss his ideas and experiences on our podcast.</p>
					<p>Brian McAtee is the guy in the band shirt. No the other guy. Brian is the one in the Metallica shirt! But forget heavy metal music, Brian loves Magic the Gathering! Whenever Brian isn't jamming, he's surrounding himself with Magic cards, literally. Need help trying to get that funky brew that's right for you? Brian's your guy. You can hear Brian share all his creative ideas about Magic and just about everything else on our podcast.</p>
